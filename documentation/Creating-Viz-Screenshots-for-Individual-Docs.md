# Creating viz screenshots for individual docs

Because we're using GitHub to house our documentation at the moment, we're limited in what we can do to make the preview images look nice. In an effort to keep things looking uniform and pretty, we're going to match our images against what the sparkline preview image looks like:

<img src="../src/components/Sparkline/sparkline.png" alt="Sparkline example image" />

There is a `Starter.tsx` file as a starting point for screenshots. It includes the border and setup to create a matching screenshot. Fork that file and stick your component where it's indicated in the file. When you take a screenshot, do your best to get the border to be the edges of the image. Once your screenshot is ready to go, run it through [compressor.io](https://compressor.io) to make it smaller.
